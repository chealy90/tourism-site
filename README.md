# Tourism Site
This site is designed to create, read, update, display, and sort data on Dublin ladnmarks from an external JSON file.
This is a simple personal project I decided to undertake during the summer to gain some basic familiarity with version control


# Features
Features include the ability to independently search sort and filter the data.
Two levels of access, guest mode and admin mode. Admin mode unlocks the ability to add, delete and edit entries.
Full accessibility implemented across all screen sizes.
