#Tourism Site

This site is designed to create, read, update, display, and sort data on Dublin ladnmarks from an external JSON file.
This also serves as my first time using git / any form of version control.

Features include the ability to independently search sort and filter the data.
Two levels of access, guest mode and admin mode. Admin mode unlocks the ability to add, delete and edit entries.
Full accessibility implemented across all screen sizes.


#Conclusion
The project is essentially finished now. I may come back in the future to make stylistic improvements or add node functionality.
